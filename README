To bootstrap the testing environment:

    Compile your source code, rename the binary as " mysh " and unpack 
    the contents of this archive (i.e., run-tests.py, pr.c, crash.c, 
    README, tests/) into the same directory as the binary.

To run all tests, simply type:

  ./run-tests.py all 20 tests/

To run a specific test, type:

  ./run-tests.py single <testNumber> tests/

as in

  ./run-tests.py single 4 tests/

Running a specific test may be useful to debug a particular problem you
are having.
